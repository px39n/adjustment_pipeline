# Matrix

title: Explain their meaning eigenvalues are zero 
color: 200, 200, 200
Extension with eigenvectors corresponding to zero-eigenvalues provides the smallest (minimal) trace. The same result is obtained when computing pseudo-inverse directly from normal matrix.
The trace of the pseudo-inverse is the same as in case of extensions with eigenvectors (it's again minimal). Pseudo-inverse matrix is exactly the same as $\mathrm{N}+$ (g-inverse with eigenvectors). So these are the same

title: Compare the cofactor Qxx Which adjustment leads to ùêê11 coinciding with ùêç+ and why?
color: 200, 200, 200
Matrices computed in both cases of Total Trace Minimization coincide best with the pseudo-inverse,
as they are all the same. This results from the fact that all points are used for datum definition in case
of those three matrices.

For partial trace, if 1 point, it will be fixed pt with 0 variance.
For others, they will get low s.

title: Lagrange Multipliers Meaning
color: 200, 200, 200
Lagrange Multipliers (LM) show the impact of the constraints into the adjustment
- The smaller their values, the smaller the impact their respective constraint too. 
- G and full trace should have a same impact
- Partial will get a alrger

color: 200, 200, 200

L1

The great advantage of LMS estimation is that it is free from the influences of geometry and so-called leverage observations have no influence on the parameter estimation.
In (Niemeier 2008, p. 368) it is stated in the context of coordinate transformations that with this method up to $50 \%$ of erroneous data (in control points or observations) can be tolerated.
Numerical¬†result¬†can¬†converge¬†to¬†a¬†wrong¬†solution ; it can not be used as the last result because it does not have statistical interpretation.

L2

Application of $L_2$-norm-estimation still yields a result that satisfies
$$
\boldsymbol{v}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{v}=\min
$$
But: Statistical interpretation of the results is no longer possible.
Further: Adjustment yields unrealistic values for the unknowns.
Consequences: Identification of erroneous observations from investigation of the residuals often impossible.
$\Rightarrow$ We have to perform a preprocessing.

$\rightarrow$ Large value $\sigma_{0 A}^2 \rightarrow$ large variances $\rightarrow$ small weights $\rightarrow$ small impact
Small / large $\sigma_{0 A}^2$ with respect to the variance factor $\sigma_0^2$ of the observations
With the choice of $\sigma_{0 A}^2$ we can find a trade-off between the influence of the control points and the inner geometry of a geodetic network.

#  Quality

```ad-example
collapse: close
title: Evaluation Statistical test
color: 200, 200, 200
- Two-sided problem, so upper and lower limits need to be calculated.
- If not accept, means there are blunders, so calculate reliability
```

```ad-example

title: Evaluation the network reliability
color: 200, 200, 200

- in order to detect blunders in our observations, large redundancy numbers (ri) are essential.

While the results for the unknowns are very similar, the standard deviations differ more significantly. 
overestimated or underestimate always
so instead of only one value ﬂ™ we use different variance factors are introduced for each group of observations.
