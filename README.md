This is based on lecture taught by [Professor Neitzel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank-Neitzel)

I work on this only out of my interest and further scientific use. 

It is not allowed to take exams yet.



# What these code can do?

3 mins for solving any problem in Adjustment. Especially the problem in adjustment (TUB) courses.

not only (Linear, non-linear, Total LST, constraint, condition, combined, dash,unknown as measurement, datum,..... anything)..


# How it work

This code only need necessary data. And information about what kind of problem it is.

This automation is mainly realized by [SYMS](https://de.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/syms.html) function in MATLAB.

# A simple example of Linear Regression

For more complex model, you can choose predefined function, define constraint, input data from file!!
