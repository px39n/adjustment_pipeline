It will take rise for taking exams by using it. I am not reponsible for that.

So it is not allowed to share without permission unless its in trust list  ( I may share after it becomes perfect)

# What these code can do?

3 mins for solving any problem in Adjustment. Especially the problem in adjustment (TUB) courses.

not only (Linear, non-linear, Total LST, constraint, condition, combined, dash,unknown as measurement, datum,..... anything)..


# Fast startup:
There are three steps to handle it



1. There are 13 examples in Template_xxx mlx, which are corresponding to the exercises in courses. Just copy the code following the instruction. And you will have a insight about how this work. 

2. Download a software called Obsidian. Open the adjustment File with obsidian, Click LST_Example_Code file.

3. In this file, There will be detailed (API) or what we called the tutorial. Its very simple, understand it combining the template.
