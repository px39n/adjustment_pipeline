This is a public GIthub owned by zhehao Liang(Tom) in TUB, based on lecture taught by [Professor Neitzel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank-Neitzel)


I work on this only out of my interest and further scientific use. 

It is not allowed to take exams yet.



# What these code can do?

3 mins for solving any problem in Adjustment. Especially the problem in adjustment (TUB) courses.

not only (Linear, non-linear, Total LST, constraint, condition, combined, dash,unknown as measurement, datum,..... anything)..


# How it work

For any adjustment problem. We always have to following procedure: 

1 Input data including(Measurement, Unknown, Error free)                     

2 Form Function Model                              

3 Form Stochastic Model.                            

4 Define Datum and Constraint Model If needed.        


After that, We have many choices to adjust that. Like GM Model(L1, L2, Linear), GH model, VCE etc,.

And you will have to use a bunch of tools to assess the quality.




**But, thanks to this program, you only have to input the data in 1, 3**

** tell it what question it is.**

**there are many predefined API and templates for different function model, adjust method, but you can customize always**


and it will automatically complete all other things for you.

This automation is realized by [SYMS](https://de.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/syms.html) function in MATLAB.
